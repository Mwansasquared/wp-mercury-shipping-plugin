# WordPress Mercury Shipping Plugin

## DISCLAIMER
This is an implementation developed by me while seeking to integrate the Mercury Logistics API into WooCommerce and is in no way a work of the Mercury Express Logistics Company.

## What does this project do?
This is a WordPress plugin that sends information to calculate the shipping fee using the Mercury Logistics Courier API and displays the result on the WooCommerce checkout page.

## Why is this project useful?
This project is useful because it provides an integration for a popular local shipping courier that local e-commerce (WooCommerce) business owners can make use of.

## How do I get started?
* To start contributing to this project, fork the repo and create a feature branch with a relevant name for an issue you would like to contribute to.
> To use the install and use the plugin on your WooCommerce website, navigate to the [releases page]([url](https://github.com/Mwansasquared/wp-mercury-shipping-plugin/releases)) and download the zip file.
